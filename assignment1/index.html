				<h2>About Me</h2>
				<p>
					I am a creative farmer with a budding enthusiasm for software
					engineering. I've developed a deep appreciation for hard work and the
					harmony of nature. Intrigued by the endless possibilities at the
					intersection of farming and technology, I embarked on a journey to
					learn software engineering.

				<h2>Why Alt School?</h2>
				<p>
					I joined AltSchoolAfrica to pursue my software engineering career with
					an unwavering passion that burns deep within me. This decision is not
					just a career choice; it's a commitment to a lifelong journey of
					self-discovery, problem-solving, and creative expression through code.
					There are several compelling reasons why I embarked on this path, and
					each one ignites my passion even further.
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<b>Love for Technology: </b>Ever since I was a child, I've been
						enamored with technology. From my first encounter with a computer to
						exploring the limitless possibilities of the internet, I've always
						been fascinated by how technology can shape and improve our lives.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Problem Solver at Heart:</b> I have always been a natural problem
						solver. There is an indescribable joy that comes from breaking down
						complex issues into manageable components and finding elegant
						solutions. Software engineering is the ultimate platform for this
						innate skill.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Creativityand Innovation:</b> Software engineering offers an
						exciting canvas for creative expression. Through code, I can bring
						my ideas to life, whether it's a groundbreaking mobile app, a
						powerful web platform, or a game-changing software solution. The
						boundless potential for innovation in this field is exhilarating.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Changing the World:</b> In today's digital age, software
						engineers are at the forefront of shaping the future. I believe that
						technology has the power to transform industries, solve global
						challenges, and make the world a better place. Being a software
						engineer means being a part of this transformative process.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Continuous Learning:</b> The tech industry is dynamic, constantly
						evolving. This continuous learning journey is both thrilling and
						challenging. I am passionate about the idea of staying on the
						cutting edge, adapting to new technologies, and expanding my
						knowledge base.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Community and Collaboration:</b> AltSchoolAfrica emphasizes
						collaboration, mentorship, and community. The prospect of learning
						alongside like-minded individuals and being part of a supportive
						network of aspiring and established software engineers fuels my
						passion. This sense of community and shared goals is invaluable.
					</li>
					<li>
						<b>Financial Independence: </b>Let's not forget the practical
						aspect. A career in software engineering offers the potential for
						financial independence, stability, and opportunities for personal
						growth. This provides the freedom to pursue my passions and dreams
						outside of work.

				<h2>Goals</h2>
				<p>
					Over the next year at AltSchoolAfrica, my goals are deeply intertwined
					with a resolute commitment to growth, both as a software engineer and
					as an individual. I aspire to harness the boundless opportunities and
					knowledge this institution offers to continually expand my technical
					skills, exploring the latest trends in software development and
